# MDC Buckling Tool

This repository provides an Excel-based calculator for predicting **knockdown factors (KDF)** of axially compressed cylindrical and conical shells using the **Mechanistic Design Curve (MDC)** introduced in:

> Wagner et al. (2025), *Structured Chaos: Redefining the Design of Buckling-Critical Cylindrical Shells*, Proceedings A.

The tool offers a modern alternative to the conservative NASA SP-8007 method by incorporating probabilistic FEM-based simulations and interpolation over geometric parameters.

## Features
- 2D interpolation of KDF based on Batdorf parameter (Z) and relative imperfection amplitude (w/t)
- Fully functional in Excel 365 and Excel 2019
- Visual feedback (✅/❌) on input validity and extrapolation
- Dynamic plots for KDF vs. Z and w/t
- Disclaimer, license terms, and usage guidelines included
