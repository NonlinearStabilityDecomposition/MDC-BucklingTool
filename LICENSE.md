💬 Why we chose an open tool model
We believe engineers should be able to test tools thoroughly before committing to licensing.
The MDC Buckling Tool is fully usable and based on transparent science.
If it helps your project or saves cost, please support further development by obtaining the appropriate license.
Let’s keep engineering honest – and excellent.
